Cleans up commenters' bad language.

== Description ==

= No More Swearing =

WP Politifier enforces a certain level of politeness in your comments, replacing recognized swear words with acronym'ed asterisks. The original text is preserved in the title attribute, visible on  mouseover.

It solves the immediate problem of keeping my comments and blog "family safe," and has SEO benefits for publishers running Adsense who want to maintain high-quality text without swearing or cursing in it.

== Installation ==

= Installation Instructions =

Download the file and extract.  To install, drop badwords.txt and the wp-politeifier.php into your Wordpress plugins directory and activate in the administrative interface.

= Notes =

The badwords list is editable through the administrative interface, and kept in a text file in the same directory.

== Screenshots ==
